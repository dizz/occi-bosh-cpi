# OCCI BOSH Cloud Provider Interface

This repo contains software designed to manage the deployment of Cloud Foundry on top of OpenStack, using Cloud Foundry BOSH. Say what?

Contained here is an implementation of the CloudFoundry [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md) Cloud Provider Interface that uses OCCI as the integration glue between CloudFoundry and any OCCI implementation, including OpenNebula and OpenStack.

This work was once a fork of the Piston Cloud Computing's OpenStack BOSH CPI.
